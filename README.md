# IoT-pot

## Description
Course project repository for "TIES4571 IoT-projekti".

## Branches
No direct pushes to "main" branch. 
Let´s try to use feature branches: create a new branch for each new feature. 

### When you start to develop a new feature: 
1. First create a new branch based on "main"
2. Name it for example "feature/my-new-feature"
3. When you are done, push the branch to Gitlab
4. Log into Gitlab and create a Merge Request to merge your branch "feature/my-new-feature" into the "main" branch.
